The agriculture industry has experienced a huge growth in the past two years in our country. This industry also accounted for a sizeable 18.8 percent (2021-2022) in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country registering a growth of 3.6 per cent in 2020-21 and 3.9 per cent in 2021-22. This industry is the backbone of the Indian economy. So, it is the important field to be developed for the beneficiary of our country.

*Problem Statement*
          It is known that the climate is having a drastic change in it and the weather condition is getting differ day by day. So, it is difficult to save the crops or a field by the sudden rain or any natural disaster like storms or etc. For example:  Nivar storm that came in the year 2020 and affected the agricultural industry very badly. This type of losses happens because of the lack of information about the changes in weather condition. It can be controlled by taking some of the precautions before the disasters.

*Solution*
      We have created a solution to control this type of agricultural losses by giving information to the farmers before the sudden change in the weather or the disaster occur by which farmer can take a precaution to save their crops and field from the natural changes. 

**What we did**
     Our project is to pass the weather information to farmers before a week or a month about the changes in the weather going to be occur. It is planned to inform the farmers with using the bot calling technology or building an application for the farmers that will inform them everything about the weather changes in a month or a week. As we know that still our farmer's our little on a backward position so many of them are not using smart phones and still using button phone, so we have planned to pass the information by bot calling and a text message to their registered mobile number in their regional language and also planned to build an application for the smart phone users. 
**Conclusion**
       This solution can stop the massive loss of the crops and grains in our country which only happens because the weather changes. By stopping this loss, it will also save billions of Indian rupees which we are losing just because of this problem.<br>
